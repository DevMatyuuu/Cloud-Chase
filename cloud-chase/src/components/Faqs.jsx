                The difference between smoking and vaping is that smoking delivers nicotine by burning tobacco, which can cause smoking-related illnesses, and vaping can deliver nicotine by heating a liquid in a much less harmful way. Vaping is less harmful and cheaper than smoking, and can have a similar feel.
